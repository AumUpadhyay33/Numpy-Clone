# Numpy-Clone in C++

Objective: 
	•	Developed a simplified clone of NumPy in C++ to handle vector and matrix operations.

Features:
	•	Vector operations: addition, subtraction, inner product.
	•	Matrix operations: addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, multiplication, transpose, norm, inversion, determinant, and eigenvalues.

Implementation:
	•	Utilizes C++ templates for generic programming.
	•	Implements fundamental linear algebra operations for educational and experimental purposes.

Usage:
	•	Provides a command-line interface for performing various operations on matrices and vectors.

Notes:
	•	Focused on basic matrix and vector manipulations without advanced features like template specialization or variadic templates.
